# Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of two reinforcement learning agents, Monte Carlo and SARSA (λ), applied to the 'TextFlappyBird-v0' game environment. The project evaluates the agents based on rewards, state-value functions, and performance metrics, exploring their policy learning and adaptation within the game.

## Agents
- **Monte Carlo Agent**: Learns from complete episodes with an epsilon-greedy policy.
- **SARSA (λ) Agent**: Utilizes eligibility traces and temporal-difference learning for updating policies.

## Environment
- `TextFlappyBird-v0`: Text-based simulation for training and evaluation.
- `TextFlappyBird-screen-v0`: For potential application in a more complex environment.

## Analysis
- Comparative study of learning progression and policy development.
- Investigation of parameter sensitivity and hyperparameter tuning.

## Figures
- State Value Function Comparisons
- Performance Metrics and Hyperparameter Tuning Results

## Usage
Details on running the simulation and analyzing the agents are provided in the respective script files.
